    "  - **Binary variables (0/1):** Represent placement decisions (e.g., whether to place a radioactive seed in a specific location in brachytherapy).\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Minimize } Z = 0.4x_1 + 0.5x_2\n",

    "This model is an example of a **mixed-integer programming** (MIP) problem, where continuous and binary decision variables are used together to optimize a medical treatment plan. This type of model is especially suitable for automated systems that need to make discrete decisions, such as placement of seeds in brachytherapy."
